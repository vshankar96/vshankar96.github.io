  "body": "### Overview.\r\nThis project is being advised by [Seyoung Kim](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sssykim/), a professor in the Computational Biology department at CMU, as well as by her graduate student [Calvin McCarter](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/cmccarte/www/). The goal of this project is to not only identify relationships between mutations in an organism’s genome (genotype) and their physical realizations (phenotype) but also to isolate mutations to their source allele, which is a specific inherited strand of DNA. Humans, which are diploid organisms, inherit two alleles; one from the mother, and one from the father. As a result, mutations existing in an individual can be inherited from either parent and affect only the allele it is present on (a cis mutation) or both allels in the genome (a trans mutation). Developing efficient methods to classify mutations as cis or trans is incredibly important due to the different ways these mutations affect global regulation, especially in terms of inheritance. Cis effects have been shown to be much more enduring and more easily inherited in many organisms. Furthermore, many trans mutations are more fundamentally linked to cis mutations and, as a result, determining which mutations play cis vs trans roles greatly improves our ability to pinpoint sources of disease-causing mutations.\r\n\r\nTo view the full project proposal, please head [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSXhOUBhyKXLr_B9OCdFNbb-UTOhDlcmoifYAmefwGQ/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Milestones\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of various milestones, as well as links to the reports as they become relevant.\r\n\r\n| Week of | Milestone                                                                                                                | Link |\r\n|:-------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\r\n| Dec. 16 | Understand background material and begin working on EM algorithm.                                      | [Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xvIGwqjZgqUpWFt16m8nZBL_OSSBbrIT7_9MUFeOo0U/edit?usp=sharing)  |\r\n| Jan. 30 | Derive the EM algorithm specifically for allele-specific expression.                                                     | N/A  |\r\n| Feb. 13 | Complete optimization of EM algorithm, derive Newton’s Method and complete optimization.                                 | N/A  |\r\n| Feb. 27 | Compare results of both methods and begin modifying cGGM for new constraints.                                            | N/A  |\r\n| Mar. 20 | Implement all parts of code and debug using small available allele-specific data sets.                                   | N/A  |\r\n| Apr. 3  | Efficiently simulate Allele-specific expression data and begin implementing competing algorithms.                        | N/A  |\r\n| Apr. 17 | Infer gene network from learned covariance matrix and perform gene enrichment analysis to determine biological validity. | N/A  |\r\n| May. 1  | Generate graphs and Manhattan plots (aka Volcano plots) and draft paper.                                                 | N/A  |\r\n\r\n",
